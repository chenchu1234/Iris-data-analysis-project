🌸 Iris Data Analysis

This project explores the famous Iris flower dataset using data analysis and visualization techniques.
The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica). 
By analyzing this dataset, we can gain insights into patterns and relationships between features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

📌 Project Objectives

Load and explore the Iris dataset.
Perform data cleaning and check for duplicates/missing values.
Generate descriptive statistics for better understanding.
Visualize the dataset using plots (scatterplots, histograms, boxplots, pairplots).
Identify species distribution.
Build a simple classification model (optional) to predict species.

🚀 How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Iris-Data-Analysis.git
cd Iris-Data-Analysis


Create & activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # for Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # for Windows


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

📈 Results & Insights

Species are linearly separable based on petal length and petal width.

Setosa is the most distinguishable species.

Sepal measurements show some overlap between Versicolor and Virginica.
